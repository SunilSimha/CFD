% FDCALC is a finite difference calculator that computes the derivative of
% a given function on the given grid using a finite differencing scheme. It
% takes as arguments:
%   givenFunc: A function handle. For example @sin.
%   grid: The grid over which the derivative is to be computed
%   method: 'forward, 'backward' or 'central' differencing schemes can be used.
%   differencing_order: The order of the derivative to be computed.
%   see also DIFF

function [derivative, outGrid] = FDCalc(givenFunc, grid, method, differencing_order)
% Checks
if ~isa(givenFunc,'function_handle')
    error('The first argument must be a function handle. For example @sin.');
elseif floor(differencing_order)~=differencing_order
    error('The differencing order must be an integer');
elseif ~isreal(grid)
    error('The grid must be a float array');
end

% First, let's compute the function over the grid:
func_over_grid = givenFunc(grid);
n = length(grid);
% Now, depending on the method chosen, the derivative is computed using
